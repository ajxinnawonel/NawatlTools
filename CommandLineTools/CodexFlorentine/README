This Node.js script provides a "first pass" at converting
the paleography of the Nahuatl text in Codex Florentine
to something that is a bit closer to the Andrews-Campbell-
Kartunnen (ACK) orthography.

After running this script over some text from the codex,
you will still have to do additional manual "repair" to get
the text into a completely standardized ACK format. Nevertheless,
this script can save you time, as it auto-converts many things for
you.

I developed this script while working on excerpts from Book 3.
The paleographic text was obtained in digital form by using OCR
software to read images from Anderson & Dibble's volume.
