**add_kvp.js**

Suppose that we have a JSON file consisting of
an array with many objects (for example, entries
in a dictionary). For each of the objects in the
array, we want to add a new key-value pair where
the value of the new key is basically a constant.

For example, suppose that for each entry, we want
to add a "src" attribute or some type of "tag"
attribute that will —at least initially— be
constant for all entries.

That is what this little script does.
