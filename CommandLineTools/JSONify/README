JSONify

jsonify.sh

"jsonify.sh" is a simple NODE.js script that takes
a data file consisting of Nahuatl flash card data
and converts it to a JSON file that can be read by
my http://unifont.org/flashcards/ nahuatl flashcard
web & mobile app.

The expected order of the data columns is already
documented within the script itself and is therefore
not repeated here.

Obviously, it would be a simple matter to modify the
script to deal with different arrangements of incoming
data.

The incoming data file may contain data for more than
one deck of cards. There is a "category" ("cat") column
that tells the script where to divide the card decks, and
the script will automatically produce one JSON data file
for each category (Be sure to put all the data for one
category next to each other in contiguous blocks, however).
