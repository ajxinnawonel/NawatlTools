PURPOSE: Converts Nahuatl in Latin script to Nahuatl in 
         the Abugida script as documented at
         https://unifont.org/nahuatl/

NOTES:   Input in TRADITIONAL orthography has been
         tested.

SUMMARY
=======

The exported "convert" function converts a Unicode 
UTF-8-encoded string containing Nahuatl text in the
"classical" orthography into the "Abugida" script
documented at https://unifont.org/nahuatl/ .

Some accomodations for transcoding Nahuatl in the
"modern" script are present, but this has not been
extensively tested.

Please note that this file, as currently written
transcodes to the PRE-UNICODE PRIVATE-USE-AREA
encoding used by the NahuatlOne digital font.
