ABOUT KEY CURRY
===============

KeyCurry is available for public use at http://unifont.org/keycurry/

Key Curry is a web application component that allows you to easily type many 
world languages and specialized orthographies in web forms and rich internet 
applications. The software uses a user interface framework called Gladiator 
Components and the popular jQuery JavaScript library as a foundation and works 
in the latest versions of Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera (limited feature set), 
and Internet Explorer version 9 (limited feature set).

Key Curry provides everything you need to type world languages and specialized 
orthographies such as the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), so there is no need 
to install complex software on your computer. Developers can incorporate Key Curry into 
web applications with a few lines of JavaScript code.

In addition to supporting major world languages and orthographies, Key Curry makes it 
extremely easy for language advocates and web developers to provide support for the 
orthographies of minority languages, especially the many languages that are not currently 
supported by the major operating system vendors.
