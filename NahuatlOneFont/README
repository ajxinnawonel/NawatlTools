The NahuatlOne font currently uses Unicode
Private Use Area (PUA) code points for the
Nahuatl Abugida documented at
http://unifont.org/nahuatl/ .

The font was built from SVG outlines that
were imported into FontForge. However FontForge
by itself is not quite enough to get OpenType
features to behave correctly. Therefore
I exported the font to Unified Font Object (UFO)
directories in order to customize the Adobe
features.fea files.

The font exists in two versions.  In the
original version, positioning of the
subjoined consonants is achieved via
GSUB and GPOS rules.

However, there is a bug in Apple products
(laptops, iPhones, iPads) that prevents
correct GPOS positioning, although GSUB
substitutions do appear to take place.
This bug may be due to the fact that the
font use PUA code points, or may be due to
some other unknown reason.

Therefore, to get around the bug on
Apple platforms, the font also exists in
a form containing thousands of generated
"ligatures" . The ligatures use references
to the component characters. Since GSUB
seems unaffected on the Apple platforms,
this version of the font seems to work
perfectly well (i.e., achieves correct
rendering) on Safari on OS X, iPhone,
and iPad.  Look in the "GenerateLigatures"
subdirectory for the script tools that
generate the ligatures.

Currently the original directories from
which these files were pulled are not 
well-documented. It may take me awhile
to achieve some better resemblance of 
order and structure in this repository.
