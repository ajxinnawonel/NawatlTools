NOTA BENE: Tools in this project may consist of C++ source code, Perl code, or tools
written in other languages (e.g., Node.js javascript). At the current time, these
tools have minimal documentation and perhaps lack make files or other nice things.
Users are therefore expected to have knowledge regarding how to compile and install 
these tools before being able to use them.  For example, for the C++ code, you may need 
to know how to install and use a command-line compiler and linker on Linux, OS X, or 
UNIX (I suppose Windows is also possible, but I'm not testing that). Also, for C++
code, expect to compile the tools using a C++11 compliant compiler.
