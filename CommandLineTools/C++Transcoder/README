SUMMARY
=======
The "first draft" of this C++ Transcoder was written to
closely follow the structure of the original Perl transcoder
as much as possible. Users may want to see the documentation
or read the source code of the Perl transcoder for more information.

However the plan going forward is to use the C++ transcoder in
place of the Perl transcoder. The Perl transcoder was written to
transcode to the Unicode Private Use Area (PUA) encoding used by
the NahuatlOne digital OpenType font.

The "first draft" of this C++ transcoder uses that same PUA encoding.
However my intention is to improve improve the C++ code in such a way 
that this tool will be easily modifiable to switch it from the current 
PUA encoding over to a Unicode-approved non-PUA encoding if and when 
we get a Unicode Proposal approved for the abugida orthography.


COMPILING
=========

convertNahuatl.cpp needs to be combined with UTF8String.cpp:

 g++ -Wall -std=c++11 -o convert convertNahuatl.cpp UTF8String.cpp

Using the above command line, the output will be called "convert".
