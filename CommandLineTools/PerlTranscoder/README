convert.pl is a command-line wrapper tool
written in Perl to convert a file containing
Nahuatl text in the classical orthography to
the Abugida orthography as documented at
https://unifont.org/nahuatl/ .  The converted
text can be typeset using the NahuatlOne digital
OpenType font.

convert.pl uses the transcode.pm Perl module
present in the Nahuatl subdirectory to do all
of the work. Look at the README file in the
Nahuatl subdirectory for more information.
