interleave.js

This is a Node.js script

This script reads 2 or more text
files and interleaves the paragraphs
of each, assigning a CSS class to
each paragraph to distinguish which
file it came from. The CSS classes
are also passed on the command line,
each preceding a file name. A colon
":" is used as a delimiter between
the class name and file name.

The use case is to interleave
a source text with translations
into one or more other languages.

For example, suppose we have a nahuatl 
text consisting of five paragraphs. We make
a Spanish translation and an English translation.
Each translation also has 5 paragraphs.

In the directory where these files and this 
script are all present, we can then run this 
script like this:

  node ./interleave.js nwt:original.txt en:english.txt es:spanish.txt > result.html

The resulting file, result.html, consists of HTML paragraphs. All of the
Nahuatl paragraphs will be marked with a class of 'nwt'. All of the English
paragraphs will have a class of 'en' and all the spanish a class of 'es'.
Also, the original.txt paragraphs will all be marked with a class of 'show'
while the translations will be marked with a class of 'hide'. You can then
use Javascript in the web page to show or hide what you want by switching 
between the 'show' and 'hide' classes.
